<P><B>PREREQUISITES</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>A decent Perl distribution (IO::Select, etc). Tested with Perl 5.005_03, 5.004m7 and 5.004_04, all run without warnings
<LI>The Net::DNS module
</UL>

<P><B>USING DEBIAN</B></P>

<P>
This couldn't be easier:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	apt-get install jdresolve
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No need to download anything by hand, as jdresolve is now a Debian app. That'll install any dependencies too :) Debian kicks ass.
</P>

<P><B>USING THE RPM PACKAGES</B> (RedHat, Mandrake, etc)</P>

<P>
Just use the following commands:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	rpm -Uvh perl-Net-DNS-0.12-1.noarch.rpm 
	rpm -Uvh jdresolve-0.6.1-1.noarch.rpm
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>USING THE .TAR.GZ OR .TAR.BZ2 PACKAGES</B> (Any distro)</P>

<P>
To install the Net::DNS module, fetch it from a CPAN mirror (http://www.cpan.org), or use the CPAN module to do it automagically.
</P>

<P>
Using the CPAN modules is simple. You can run it from the command line or interactively:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>command line: perl -MCPAN -e "command"
<LI>interactive:  perl -MCPAN -e shell
</UL>

<P>
To keep you Perl distribution updated, you should issue command like "install Bundle::CPAN" regularly. Here is some sample output:
</P>

<PRE>
   [root@xhost /root]# perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::CPAN"
   CPAN: LWP::UserAgent loaded ok
   Fetching with LWP:
     ftp://cpan.if.usp.br/pub/mirror/CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz

   CPAN: Compress::Zlib loaded ok
   Going to read /root/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
   Scanning cache /root/.cpan/build for sizes

   MD5 is up to date.
   File::Spec is up to date.
   Compress::Zlib is up to date.
   Archive::Tar is up to date.
   Data::Dumper is up to date.
   Net::Telnet is up to date.
   Net::Cmd is up to date.
   Term::ReadKey is up to date.
   Term::ReadLine::Perl is up to date.
   CPAN::WAIT is up to date.
   CPAN is up to date.
</PRE>

<P>
So for jdresolve to work, you should at least issue an "install Net::DNS".
</P>

<P>
After that just go back to where you unpacked jdresolve and run './configure' and then 'make install' as root.
