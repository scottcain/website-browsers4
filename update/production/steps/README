===========================
WormBase production update process

Placing everything in the admin framework.

Steps.

1. steps/push_acedb.pl  (via cron)

This can sync via a tarball package, rsync of a single
acedb database directory, or rsync of all directories.
W::U::Production::PushAcedb needs to be edited to switch
between these options.

Currently, this script keeps all acedb/wormbase_* directories
in sync and is run by cron as:

0 3 12-31 * * /home/tharris/projects/wormbase/website-admin/update/production/steps/push_acedb.pl


2. steps/push_support_databases.pl (via cron).

As with push_acedb.pl, this can sync via a tarball package, 
rsync of a single database directory, or rsync of all 
directories. W::U::Production::PushSupportDatabases needs 
to be edited to switch between these options. 

Currently, this script keeps all support/WS* directories
in sync and is run by cron as:

0 3 12-31 * * /home/tharris/projects/wormbase/website-admin/update/production/steps/push_support_databases.pl
