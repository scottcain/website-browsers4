To remove entries from the cache (eg the Location widget on the Clone page)

1. staging/steps/purge_entries_from_couchdb.pl --release WS230 --widget Location --class Clone --host couchdb.wormbase.org

2. Clear entries from the logs
    To be able to recache these entries, they need to be removed from the logs.
 
   cd /usr/local/wormbase/databases/WS230/cache/logs
   mv clone.txt clone.txt.original
   staging/steps/purge_entries_from_cache_logs.pl clone.txt.original > clone.txt

3. Re-cache
   staging/steps/precache_content.pl --release WS230 --host production
