README
	This file. Duh.

import_references/
	Scripts for importing a huge number of references in batch.

plugins/
	The official plug-in source from citeulike.org.
	This was *originally* checked out via svn but has
	since been checked in to my private repository to
	simplify development across machines.

plugins-wormbase
	WormBase-specific plugin files.  These are maintained
	outside of the citeulike directory for easy updating
 	from that source.  Symlinks in plugins/ point to these files.

plugins/original_source.tgz
	The checked out source from the citeuelike.org
	subversion repository.  Unpack and svn update
	to get up-to-date source.



To test:
cd
