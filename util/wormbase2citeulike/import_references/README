Purpose: Import the entire corpus of C. elegans literature into CiteULike.

This directory contains files suitable for migrating all Pubmed
references that cite C. elegans into citeulike.org.

Strategy:

1. Use Texmed to search PubMed and retrieve BibTex entries.

(CiteULike can't import PubMed in batch)

http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~mueller/TeXMed/

I set up my own local installation on brie3 and modified it to suit my needs.

http://dev.wormbase.org/db/misc/TexMed

Modified code now part of this distro.


2.  Reformat BibTex entries.

The bibtex entries from TeXMed have some problems.  Clean them up.

./clean_bibtext.pl bibtext_entries.pl

This will create a single file for each year in refs/.

-------------
Currently, importing references into citeulike results in major buggotea.
Citeulike does not try and uniquify these references and match them to other
references already in the database.



Directory contents:

README -- this file
TeXMed-modified.tgz -- TeXMed CGI with modified output and limits
clean_bibtext.pl -- cleans output from TeXMed
fetch_elegans_refs_from_citeulike.pl -- parses out references tagged with elegans
       from a citeulike bibtext library 
refs_bibtex -- references in (unparsed) bibtext format
refs_by_year -- output dir from clean_bibtex.pl
test.ref -- a test bibtex reference
